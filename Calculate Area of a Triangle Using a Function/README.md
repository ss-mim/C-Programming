# Area of a Triangle Using Function in C

This is a **C program** that calculates the area of a triangle using a **function**.

## How It Works
- The program defines a function `calculateArea(float base, float height)` that returns the area of a triangle.
- The user inputs the base and height of the triangle.
- The function is called with the input values, and the computed area is stored in a variable.
- The area is then displayed as output.

## Example Usage
```
Enter base of the triangle: 5
Enter height of the triangle: 10
The area of the triangle is: 25.00
```

## Features
- Uses a **function** for better modularity and reusability.
- Reads input using `scanf()`.
- Displays the result using `printf()`.

## Header Files Used
- `<stdio.h>` for input/output functions (`printf`, `scanf`)

## Notes
- Can be extended to handle different input formats.
- The function can be modified to take input inside the function instead of `main()`.

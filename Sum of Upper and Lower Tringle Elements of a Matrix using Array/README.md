# Sum of Upper and Lower Triangle Elements in C

This C program calculates the **sum of upper and lower triangle elements** in a square matrix.

## How It Works
- The user inputs the **size of the square matrix** (N × N).
- The user enters the **matrix elements**.
- The program calculates:
  - The **sum of upper triangle elements** (including diagonal).
  - The **sum of lower triangle elements** (including diagonal).
- The results are displayed.


## Example Usage
```
 Enter the size of the square matrix: 3
 Enter the elements of the matrix:
 1 2 3
 4 5 6
 7 8 9

Sum of Upper Triangle elements: 26
Sum of Lower Triangle elements: 26
```

## Features
- Uses **2D arrays** to store matrix elements.
- Uses **loop conditions** to identify upper and lower triangle elements.
- Efficient O(n²) time complexity.

## Header Files Used
- `<stdio.h>` for input/output functions (`printf`, `scanf`)


## Notes
- This program only works for **square matrices**.
- The main diagonal is included in both sums.

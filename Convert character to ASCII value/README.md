# C Program to Convert Character to ASCII Value  


This **C program** takes an **Character** as input from the user and converts it to the corresponding **ASCII Value**.

## How It Works
- The program prompts the user to input an **Character** (an alphabet).
- The program then converts the alphabet to its corresponding ASCII Value using the `printf` function with the `%d` format specifier.
- The character corresponding to the Character is then displayed.

# Example Output

```
Enter any ASCII character is : A
The ASCII value: 65

```

# Features
- Demonstrates how to convert a Character to its corresponding ASCII value in C.
- Uses the %d format specifier in printf to display the ASCII value.
- A simple program suitable for beginners to understand basic input/output operations.

# Header Files Used
`<stdio.h>` for input/output functions (`printf`, `scanf`).

# Notes
- Character range from `A to Z` and `a to z`, from **A to Z** , ASCII value **65 to 90** representing uppercase English letters .
- This program works for both lowercase and uppercase ASCII characters, as well as special characters.

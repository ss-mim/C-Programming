# Largest Number Finder (Three Numbers)

This is a simple C program that determines the largest of three given integers.

## How It Works
- The program prompts the user to enter three integers.
- It compares the three numbers using `if-else` conditions:
  - If the first number is the largest, it prints that as the largest number.
  - If the second number is the largest, it prints that as the largest number.
  - Otherwise, the third number is the largest.


## Example Usage
```
Enter three integers: 12 25 9
The largest number is: 25
```
```
Enter three integers: 10 10 5
The largest number is: 10
```
```
Enter three integers: 7 7 7
The largest number is: 7
```

## Header Files Used
- `<stdio.h>` for input/output functions (`printf`, `scanf`)

## Notes
- Ensure that you enter valid integers.
- The program handles cases where numbers are equal.

# Triangle Area Calculator

This is a simple C program that calculates the area of a triangle using the formula:

```
Area = 0.5 × Base × Height
```

## How It Works
- The program prompts the user to enter the base and height of the triangle.
- It reads the input values and calculates the area using the formula.
- Finally, it prints the calculated area.



## Example Usage
```
Enter Base = 5
Enter Height = 10
Area of the triangle = 25.00
```

## Header Files Used
- `<stdio.h>` for input/output functions (`printf`, `scanf`)

## Notes
- Ensure that you enter valid numeric values.
- The area is calculated using floating-point division to ensure accuracy.
- The result is displayed with two decimal places for better readability.

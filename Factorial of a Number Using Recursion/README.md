# Factorial Using Recursion in C

This is a **C program** that calculates the **factorial** of a number using **recursion**.

## How It Works
- The user inputs a **positive integer**.
- The program calculates the **factorial** using a recursive function.
- The result is displayed.

# Example Usage
```
Enter a positive integer: 5
Factorial of 5 is 120
```
# Features
- Uses **recursion** for efficient computation.
- Checks for **invalid input (negative numbers)**.
- Simple and easy-to-understand implementation.

# Header Files
```<stdio.h>``` for input/output functions ```(printf, scanf)```

# Notes
- The factorial of **0 and 1** is **1**.
- The program prevents negative numbers since factorial is **not defined for them**.
- Can be extended to use **iteration instead of recursion**.

# C Program to Convert ASCII Value to Character

This **C program** takes an **ASCII value** as input from the user and converts it to the corresponding **character**.

## How It Works
- The program prompts the user to input an **ASCII value** (an integer).
- The program then converts the integer to its corresponding character using the `printf` function with the `%c` format specifier.
- The character corresponding to the ASCII value is then displayed.

# Example Output

```
Enter any ASCII value: 65
The ASCII character is : A
```

# Features
- Demonstrates how to convert an ASCII value to its corresponding character in C.
- Uses the %c format specifier in printf to display the character.
- A simple program suitable for beginners to understand basic input/output operations.

# Header Files Used
`<stdio.h>` for input/output functions (`printf`, `scanf`).

# Notes
- ASCII values range from 0 to 127, with values from **65 to 90** representing uppercase English letters ('A' to 'Z').
- This program works for both lowercase and uppercase ASCII characters, as well as special characters.

# Simple Calculator

This is a simple **C program** that performs basic arithmetic operations (**addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division**) using a `switch` statement.

## How It Works
- The user enters two numbers.
- The user selects an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
- The program performs the operation based on the selected operator.
- The result is displayed.


## Example Usage
```
Enter first number: 10
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): *
Enter second number: 5
Result: 50.00
```

## Features
- Supports **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division**.
- Handles **division by zero** to prevent errors.
- Uses a `switch` statement for better readability and efficiency.

## Header Files Used
- `<stdio.h>` for input/output functions (`printf`, `scanf`)

## Notes
- The program takes floating-point numbers as input.
- Division by zero is **not allowed**, and an error message is displayed if attempted.
- The result is displayed with **two decimal places** for clarity.

# Largest Number Finder

This is a simple C program that determines the larger of two given integers or checks if they are equal.

## How It Works
- The program prompts the user to enter two integers.
- It compares the two numbers using `if-else` conditions:
  - If the first number is greater, it prints that as the larger number.
  - If the second number is greater, it prints that as the larger number.
  - If both numbers are equal, it prints a message indicating equality.


## Example Usage
```
Enter two integers: 8 15
The larger number is: 15
```
```
Enter two integers: 10 5
The larger number is: 10
```
```
Enter two integers: 7 7
Both numbers are equal.
```

## Header Files Used
- `<stdio.h>` for input/output functions (`printf`, `scanf`)

## Notes
- Ensure that you enter valid integers.
- The program uses basic conditional statements for comparison.

# Circle Area Calculator

This is a simple C program that calculates the area of a circle using the formula:

```
Area = π × Radius × Radius
```

## How It Works
- The program prompts the user to enter the radius of the circle.
- It reads the input value and calculates the area using the formula.
- Finally, it prints the calculated area.



## Example Usage
```
Enter Radius: 5
Area of the circle = 78.54
```

## Header Files Used
- `<stdio.h>` for input/output functions (`printf`, `scanf`)

## Notes
- Ensure that you enter a valid numeric value.
- The area is calculated using floating-point arithmetic to ensure accuracy.
- The result is displayed with two decimal places for better readability.

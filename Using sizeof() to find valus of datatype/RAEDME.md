# C Program to Display Size of Different Data Types

This **C program** displays the size (in bytes) of different **data types** such as `int`, `float`, `double`, and `char`.

## How It Works
- The program uses the `sizeof()` operator to find and print the size of each data type.
- The size of each data type is displayed in **bytes**.

# Example Output
```
Size of int = 4 bytes
Size of float = 4 bytes
Size of double = 8 bytes
Size of char = 1 byte
```
# Features
- Demonstrates the use of the `sizeof()` operator in C.
- Displays the sizes of common data types: `int`, `float`, `double`, and `char`.
- Helpful for understanding **memory usage** for different types in C programming.

# Header Files Used
`<stdio.h>` for input/output functions (`printf`).

# Notes
- The sizes of data types can vary depending on the **system architecture** (32-bit vs 64-bit).
- This program is simple and useful for understanding how C handles different types of data and memory management.

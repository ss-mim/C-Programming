# Swapping and Sum Calculation using Pointers in C

This is a **C program** that demonstrates how to use **pointers** to swap two numbers and calculate their sum.

## How It Works
- The program defines two functions:
  - `swap(int *a, int *b)`: Swaps two numbers using pointers.
  - `sum(int *a, int *b)`: Returns the sum of two numbers using pointers.
- Inside the `main()` function:
  - The user inputs two integers.
  - The program displays the original values.
  - The `swap()` function swaps the values using pointers.
  - The swapped values are displayed.
  - The `sum()` function calculates and displays the sum of the swapped numbers.


## Example Output
```
Enter two numbers: 5 10

Before swapping:
num1 = 5, num2 = 10

After swapping:
num1 = 10, num2 = 5

Sum of numbers: 15
```

## Features
- Demonstrates how to **use pointers** in C programming.
- Implements **function-based swapping** of two variables.
- Uses **pointers to calculate the sum** of two numbers.

## Header Files Used
- `<stdio.h>` for input/output functions (`printf`, `scanf`).

## Notes
- The program can be modified to handle more operations using pointers.
- Can be extended to perform arithmetic operations dynamically based on user input.

# Sum and Average of Three Numbers

This is a simple C program that takes three integers as input from the user, calculates their sum and average, and displays the results.

## How It Works
- The program prompts the user to enter three integers.
- It reads the input values and calculates their sum.
- It then computes the average by dividing the sum by 3.
- Finally, it prints the sum and the average.


## Example Usage
```
Enter three numbers: 5 10 15
The sum of three numbers is: 30
The average of three numbers is: 10.00
```

## Header Files Used
- `<stdio.h>` for input/output functions (`printf`, `scanf`)

## Notes
- Ensure that you enter valid integer values.
- The average is calculated using floating-point division to ensure accuracy.
- The result is displayed with two decimal places for better readability.

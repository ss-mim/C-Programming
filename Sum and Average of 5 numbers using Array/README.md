This is a **C program** that calculates the **sum and average** of 5 numbers using an **array**.

## How It Works
- The user enters **5 numbers**.
- The program stores them in an **array**.
- It calculates the **sum** of the numbers.
- It calculates the **average** by dividing the sum by **5**.
- The sum and average are displayed as output.


## Example Usage
```
Enter 5 numbers: 10 20 30 40 50
Sum = 150
Average = 30.00
```

## Features
- Uses an **array** to store numbers.
- Uses a **loop** to take input and calculate sum.
- Displays **sum and average** with two decimal places.

## Header Files Used
- `<stdio.h>` for input/output functions (`printf`, `scanf`)

## Notes
- Works with **integer inputs**.
- Uses **type casting (`float`)** to ensure accurate average calculation.

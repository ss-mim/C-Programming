# Matrix Addition & Subtraction in C

This is a **C program** that performs **matrix addition and subtraction** using arrays.

## How It Works
- The user inputs the number of **rows and columns** for the matrices.
- The program asks for **two matrices** as input.
- It performs **addition** and **subtraction** element-wise.
- The results are displayed as **new matrices**.


## Example Usage
```
Enter number of rows and columns: 2 2
Enter elements of first matrix:
1 2
3 4
Enter elements of second matrix:
5 6
7 8

Matrix Addition:
6 8
10 12

Matrix Subtraction:
-4 -4
-4 -4
```

## Features
- Uses **arrays** to store and manipulate matrices.
- Supports **user-defined matrix sizes**.
- Performs **both addition and subtraction**.

## Header Files Used
- `<stdio.h>` for input/output functions (`printf`, `scanf`)

## Notes
- The program assumes both matrices have the **same dimensions**.
- The output matrices are displayed in a **formatted manner**.
- Can be extended to include **multiplication and transpose operations**.

# Sum of Two Numbers Using Function in C

This is a **C program** that calculates the sum of two numbers using a **function**.

## How It Works
- The program defines a function `sum(int a, int b)` that returns the sum of two numbers.
- The user inputs two numbers.
- The function is called with the input values, and the result is stored in a variable.
- The sum is then displayed as output.

## Example Usage
```
Enter two numbers: 5 7
The sum of 5 and 7 is: 12
```

## Features
- Uses a **function** to improve modularity and reusability.
- Reads input using `scanf()`.
- Displays the result using `printf()`.

## Header Files Used
- `<stdio.h>` for input/output functions (`printf`, `scanf`)

## Notes
- Can be extended to handle floating-point numbers by modifying the function to use `float` instead of `int`.
- Can be modified to take input inside the function instead of `main()`.

# Rectangle Area Calculator

This is a simple C program that calculates the area of a rectangle using the formula:

```
Area = Length Ã— Width
```

## How It Works
- The program prompts the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle.
- It reads the input values and calculates the area using the formula.
- Finally, it prints the calculated area.


## Example Usage
```
Enter Length: 5
Enter Width: 10
Area of the rectangle = 50.00
```

## Header Files Used
- `<stdio.h>` for input/output functions (`printf`, `scanf`)

## Notes
- Ensure that you enter valid numeric values.
- The area is calculated using floating-point arithmetic to ensure accuracy.
- The result is displayed with two decimal places for better readability.

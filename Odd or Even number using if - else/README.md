# Even or Odd Number Checker

This is a simple C program that checks whether a given integer is even or odd.

## How It Works
- The program prompts the user to enter an integer.
- It checks if the number is divisible by 2:
  - If true, it prints that the number is **Even**.
  - Otherwise, it prints that the number is **Odd**.



## Example Usage
```
Enter an integer number: 7
7 is an Odd number.
```
```
Enter an integer number: 10
10 is an Even number.
```

## Header Files Used
- `<stdio.h>` for input/output functions (`printf`, `scanf`)

## Notes
- Ensure that you enter a valid integer.
- This program uses the modulo (`%`) operator to check divisibility by 2.
